## Loading Data


```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
# read in data
order <- read_csv("casestudy.csv")
summary(order)
```
I am going to create an output table where I will be storing the values of all the analysis I do

```{r}
# creating output data and adding year to output
year <- order %>%
  select(year) %>%
  unique()
output <- tibble(year)
output$year <- as.integer(output$year)
```


## Total revenue for the current year

```{r}
TotalRevenue <- order %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(TotalRevenue = sum(net_revenue)) %>%
  select(TotalRevenue, year) %>%
  unique()

#adding total revenue to output
output <- output %>%
  left_join(TotalRevenue, by = "year")
```

## New Customer Revenue e.g. new customers not present in previous year only

```{r}
order <- order %>%
  group_by(customer_email) %>%
  mutate(new_customer = case_when(year == min(year) ~ TRUE, year > min(year) ~ FALSE))

#computing new customer revenue
NewCustomerRevenue <- order %>%
  filter(new_customer == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(NewCustomerRevenue = sum(net_revenue)) %>%
  select(NewCustomerRevenue, year) %>%
  unique()

#adding new customer revenue to output
output <- output %>%
  left_join(NewCustomerRevenue, by = "year")

```

## Existing Customer Growth 

```{r}
#computing and adding to output
output <- output %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(ExistingCustomerGrowth = (TotalRevenue - NewCustomerRevenue) - (lag(TotalRevenue) - lag(NewCustomerRevenue)))
```
## Revenue lost from attrition 

```{r}
#computing and  adding to output
output <- output %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(RevenueLostAttrition = lag(TotalRevenue) - (TotalRevenue - NewCustomerRevenue))
```

## Existing Customer Revenue Current year

```{r}
#computing and  adding to output
output <- output %>%
  mutate(ExistingCustomerRevenue = TotalRevenue - NewCustomerRevenue)
```
## Existing Customer Revenue Prior year

```{r}
#computing and  adding to output
output <- output %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(ExistingCustomerRevenue_prior = lag(TotalRevenue) - lag(NewCustomerRevenue))
```
## Total Customers Current year and Previous year

```{r}
TotalCustomers <- order %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(TotalCustomers = n()) %>%
  select(TotalCustomers, year) %>%
  unique() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(TotalCustomersPrior = lag(TotalCustomers))

# adding total customers current year and total customers previous year to output
output <- output %>%
  left_join(TotalCustomers, by = "year")
```

## New Customers

```{r}
NewCustomers <- order %>%
  filter(new_customer == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(NewCustomers = n()) %>%
  select(NewCustomers, year) %>%
  unique()

#adding new customers to output
output <- output %>%
  left_join(NewCustomers, by = "year")
```

## Lost customers

```{r}
#computing and  adding to output
output <- output %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(LostCustomers = lag(TotalCustomers) - (TotalCustomers - NewCustomers))
```
## Viewing the output of all the above questions

```{r}
View(output)
```
As shown in the above results, I have calculated separately for each year.Where ever there are questions such as prior year or lost customers in first year(2015) the value is NA as we dont have any data for the year prior to 2015.

## Plots highlighting information from the dataset

```{r}
output %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = NewCustomers, color = "New")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = LostCustomers, color = "Lost")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Customers", title = "Customers Gained and Lost per Year") +
  scale_color_manual("", breaks = c("New", "Lost"), values = c("Lost" = "black", "New" = "red"))
```
In the above graph, we can see that the customer gain in 2016 was the least of all three years and we lost more customers than gain in the same year(2016). Year 2017 was a better year when compared to gaining and losing customers. We lost less customers in year 2016 to 2017 then in year 2015 to 2016 and got a momentum in gaining new customers. 


```{r}
output %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = NewCustomerRevenue / TotalRevenue), fill = "blue", alpha = .5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "", title = "Percent of New Customer Revenue by Year")
```
In the above graph, I have checked the revenue generated by the new customers over the year. Year 2015 has the highest revenue generated followed by 2017 and lastly there was a dip in the revenue in year 2016 as many customers were lost which we saw in the previous visualization
